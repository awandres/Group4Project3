# Ransom Angular


## User Story Bronze

Users will be able to input text and generate images in place of strings, for example the letter 'a' will be replaced with an image of the letter a. This will be done by using the flickr API for letters. The users string will be broken up into individual letters and after being replaced by images they will be put back together to create an word or phrase.

## User Story Silver

At the Silver level users will have their string randomized and in some cases by replaced by not only images but also be turned into anagrams.

##User Story Gold

At the Gold level users will notice that some words are completely replaced by images for example the word duck is now replaced with an image of a duck instead of individual letters representing the word duck.
